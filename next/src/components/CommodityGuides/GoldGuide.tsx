        <h2>WHAT MAKES GOLD A PRECIOUS METAL?</h2>
        <p>
          This is a classification of specific metals that are considered rare
          and have a higher economic value compared to other metals. There are
          five main precious metals openly traded on various exchanges, gold is
          the biggest market. Gold is sometimes referred to as monetary metals
          as it has historical uses as a currency and is seen as a store of
          value. While relatively small, gold does also have an industrial
          component because it is less reactive, a good conductor, highly
          malleable and doesn’t corrode.
        </p>
      </li>

        <h2>WHAT IS SPOT GOLD?</h2>
        <p>
          The spot gold price refers to the price of gold for immediate
          delivery. Transactions for bullion coins are almost always priced
          using the spot price as a basis. The spot gold market is trading very
          close to 24 hours a day as there is almost always a location somewhere
          in the world that is actively taking orders for gold transactions. New
          York, London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Zurich are where most of
          the trading activity takes place. Whenever bullion dealers in any of
          these cities are active, we indicate this on our website with the
          message “Spot Market is Open”. For the high and low values, we are
          showing the lowest bid and the highest ask of the day.

        <h2>GOLD PRICE - FUTURES MARKET</h2>
        <p>
          The gold futures market is one of a number of commodity futures,
          wherein contracts are entered into, agreeing to buy or sell gold at a
          certain price at a specified future date. Gold futures are used both
          as a way for gold producers and market makers to hedge their products
          against fluctuations in the market, and as a way for speculators to
          make money off of those same movements in the market. <br /> <br />
          A precious metals futures contract is a legally binding agreement for
          delivery of a metal in the future at an agreed-upon price. The
          contracts are standardized by a futures exchange as to quantity,
          quality, time and place of delivery. Only the price is variable.{" "}
          <br /> <br />
          Hedgers use these contracts as a way to manage their price risk on an
          expected purchase or sale of the physical metal. They also provide
          speculators with an opportunity to participate in the markets by
          lodging exchange required margin. <br />
          <br />
          There are two different positions that can be taken: A long (buy)
          position is an obligation to accept delivery of the physical metal,
          while a short (sell) position is the obligation to make delivery. The
          great majority of futures contracts are offset prior to the delivery
          date. For example, this occurs when an investor with a long position
          sells that position prior to delivery notice.
        </p>

        <h2>SPOT GOLD PRICE VS GOLD FUTURES PRICE</h2>
        <p>
          There is usually a difference between the spot price of gold and the
          future price. The future price, which we also display on this page, is
          used for futures contracts and represents the price to be paid on the
          date of a delivery of gold in the future. In normal markets, the
          futures price for gold is higher than the spot. The difference is
          determined by the number of days to the delivery contract date,
          prevailing interest rates, and the strength of the market demand for
          immediate physical delivery. The difference between the spot price and
          the future price, when expressed as an annual percentage rate is known
          as the “forward rate”.

        <h2>CHANGE (CHANGE IN GOLD PRICE FROM PREVIOUS CLOSE)</h2>
        <p>
          This is the change in the price of the metal from the previous close,
          which is not necessarily the previous day. Weekdays from 6:00 PM NY
          time until midnight the previous close is from the current day. Here’s
          why: The time the gold market stops trading in New York on weekdays is
          for a 60 min period, from 5:00 PM New York time until 6:00 PM. We use
          the last quote at 5:00 PM as the close of that given day. Change is
          always the difference between the current price and the price at
          5:00pm. For example: Gold last traded at $1,200 at 5:00 PM on January
          17. If it is January 17 at 6:30 PM and the price is $1,202, we will
          show a change of +2.00. If it is January 18 at 5:00 PM and gold is
          quoted at $1,225 then we would show a change of +25.00 at that time.

        <h2>GOLD FUTURES CHANGE (CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS CLOSE)</h2>
        <p>
          This is the change in the price of the metal from the price at the end
          of the previous trading session. Currently, the weekday closing time
          is 2:00 PM Eastern Time.

        <h2>30 DAY CHG (30-DAY CHANGE)</h2>

          This is the change in the price of the metal from 30 days ago as
          opposed from the previous close.

        <p>
          Every precious metals market has a corresponding benchmark price that
          is set on a daily basis. These benchmarks are used mostly for
          commercial contracts and producer agreements. These benchmarks are
          calculated partly from trading activity in the spot market. <br />
          <br />
          The spot price is determined from trading activity on Over-The-Counter
          (OTC) decentralized markets. An OTC is not a formal exchange and
          prices are negotiated directly between participants with most of the
          transaction taking place electronically. Although these aren’t
          regulated, financial institutions play an important role, acting as
          market makers, providing a bid and ask price in the spot market.

        <h2>
          I&#39;VE HEARD THAT GOLD TRADED 24/7 &mdash; IS THAT TRUE? IS THERE AN
          OPEN AND A CLOSE?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Gold, actually trades 23 hours a day Sunday through Friday. Most OTC
          markets overlap each other; there is a one-hour period between 5 p.m.
          and 6 p.m. eastern time where no market is actively trading. However,
          despite this one hour close, because spot is traded on OTC markets,
          there are no official opening or closing prices. <br />
          <br />
          For larger transactions, most precious metals traders will use a
          benchmark price that is taken at specific periods during the trading
          day.

        <h2>WHAT IS THE BID PRICE FOR GOLD?</h2>
        <p>
          The bid price is the highest price someone is willing to pay for an
          ounce of gold.

      <li>
        <h2>WHAT IS THE ASK PRICE FOR GOLD?</h2>
        <p>
          The ask price is the lowest price someone is willing to sell an ounce
          of gold.

      <li>
        <h2>WHAT DOES THE SPREAD MEAN FOR THE GOLD PRICE PER OUNCE TODAY?</h2>
        <p>
          The spread is the price difference between the bid and the ask price.
          Both gold and silver are fairly liquid markets so traders can expect
          to see a fairly narrow spread in these markets; however, other
          precious metals may have wider spreads, reflecting a more illiquid
          marketplace.

      <li>
        <h2>IS THERE A GOLD BENCHMARK?</h2>
        <p>
          Because there is no official closing or opening price for gold or
          silver, market participants rely on benchmark prices, set during
          different times of the day by different organizations. These
          benchmarks are also referred to as fixings.
          <br />
          <br />
          The London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) is the leading
          organization that is responsible for maintaining benchmarks for all
          precious metals. The LBMA Gold Price, the LBMA Silver Price, and the
          LBMA PGM Price are the widely accepted benchmarks in the precious
          metals space. Kitco.com also provides a variety of benchmark prices
          for gold and silver. <br />
          <br />
          The benchmark price is determined twice daily in an electronic auction
          between participating banks with the LBMA, which is administered by
          ICE Benchmark Administration.

        <h2>GOLD FIXES</h2>
        <p>
          For almost 100 years, the main gold benchmark price was set by the
          London Gold Fix. The price was determined in a closed physical auction
          among bullion banks. A price is determined after most buy orders
          matched most sell orders. <br />
          <br />
          These auctions would take place twice daily, once in the morning and
          once in the afternoon in London, England. <br />
          <br />
          However, the London Gold Fix shut down in 2015 and the responsibility
          for maintaining the process fell to the LBMA, which created the LBMA
          Gold Price on March 2015. The association shifted the price matching
          mechanism from a physical auction to an open electronic auction among
          its members.
          <br />
          <br />
          The benchmark is still set twice a day at 10:30 a.m. and then at 3
          p.m. London time. There are thirteen participating banks, including
          the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank,
          Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank USA NA, ICBC Standard Bank, JP
          Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, The Bank
          of Nova Scotia - ScotiaMocatta, The Toronto Dominion Bank and UBS.

        <h2>SHANGHAI FIX</h2>
        <p>
          Launched in 2016, the benchmark price mechanism in China is known as
          the Shanghai Gold Benchmark price. The price setting follows the same
          process as the London Gold Price in that the price is set twice daily.
          However, it is denominated in yuan (or renminbi) rather than U.S.
          dollars. The price is also derived from a 1-kg contract. The benchmark
          is listed on the Shanghai Gold Exchange.
