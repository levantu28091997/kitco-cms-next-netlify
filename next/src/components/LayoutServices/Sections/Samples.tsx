                    Gold prices have fallen as equity markets have recovered.
                    Trade tensions have eased between China and the U.S. as the
                    Trump administration tries to calm concerns amid an impasse
                    on government funding. Investors remain cautious, however,
                    since there has not been anything solid in terms of trade.
                    Current performance of equities, bonds, and commodities
                    could be influenced by a reallocation of assets, which
                    occurs in January. Unresolved political issues remain in
                    both the U.S. and the U.K, acting as a headwind to equities
                    and pushing investors into safe haven assets, similar to
                    what occurred in December.

                    Gold prices have run up sharply over the past week.
                    Technical chart indicators suggest overbought conditions,
                    which could make gold prices vulnerable to the downside.
                    Prices have support at $1,315. Fundamentals for gold remain
                    supportive for the near term, with ongoing uncertainty about
                    various political issues. In the United States, there is
                    little progress made with regard to finding funding for a
                    Mexico-U.S. border wall. The uncertainty of finding a
                    solution to this issue and the possibility of another
                    shutdown or a declaration of national emergency by Donald
                    Trump should be supportive of gold. Trade talks between the
                    U.S. and China remain on track, but there still are various
                    issues that require resolution and until there is a final
                    agreement markets will remain on edge, which also should be
                    positive for gold. Amid these and other political issues
                    between the U.S. and Russia and Britain and the E.U. gold
                    prices should be supported at current levels. Investors with
                    long positions should hold their positions with a price
                    target of $1,330, fresh long positions can be built if
                    prices slip to $1,315.

                    Gold moved to trade in a wide range recently, between $1,290
                    and $1,330. Prices moved higher as market participants
                    rolled their position from the April Comex contract to the
                    June Comex contract. Price volatility has picked up and is
                    likely to continue. While economic conditions appear to be
                    firm, albeit expanding at a slower pace than last year,
                    political headwinds remain. Brexit is still in the headlines
                    in addition to traded issues between China and the U.S.

                    There is now a head a shoulders pattern formed for gold,
                    which suggest if prices fall below $1,287 or around there
                    then gold could drop to as low as $1,210. This said, there
                    also is much going on politically that could affect the
                    financial and economies that push gold higher, perhaps above
                    $1,350. While CPM is suggesting higher gold prices for these
                    next several trading days, there should also be
                    opportunities to buy on the dips and sell on the peaks,
                    picking price points.
